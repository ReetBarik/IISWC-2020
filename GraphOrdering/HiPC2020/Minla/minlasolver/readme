A multilevel algorithmm for the minimum linear arrangement problem
==================================================================

- Tested with gcc 3.X.X/4.X.X and LEDA library 6.X.
- Before you compile don't forget to define environment variables $LEDA and $LEDAROOT
- Run executable "minla
  Example : $ minla graph_input.rmf params1 random-seed
- Examples of input graphs: c1y.rmf, memplus.rmf
- If the OUTPUT_ORDERING parameter is YES, the following output will be produced:
    visgraph.m - matlab code for showing the adjacency matrices of the original and rearranged graphs
    arr_[data-time].dat - list of nonzero entries for the matlab sparse matrix of rearranged graph
    id_[date-time].dat - list of nonzero entries for the matlab sparse matrix of original (not rearranged) graph
    Note that in both dat files only one of the lower or upper triangular parts is printed out (see M = M + M' in visgraph.m)
    nodes_order.dat - arrangement of nodes
