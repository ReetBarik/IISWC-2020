Step 1: 'make' in the Gorder directory to generate the executable 'Gorder'.

Step 2: Prepare the input graph file such that it is in the form of an edgelist (similar format as the datasets on SNAP). 		  Please note that the indexing of the nodes in the edgelist must be continuous and start from 0.

Step 3: The command to run Gorder is: ./Gorder /path/to/input/file
		The output will be in the same format as the input (edgelist) but the vertices will have been reordered.
